            <h1><b>Info about Gaming Bucket</b></h1>

    </center>

As said on the <a href="index.html">Home Page</a>, Gaming Bucket is four highschoolers who are learning to code as a team by using applications like <a href="https://github.com/"> GitHub</a> and <a href="https://atom.io/"> Atom </a> to create and share code to create websites with a JavaScript magic 8ball, or browser based video games from JavaScript. But what are the members goals of the company? And how will they achieve their goals?

<center>

<h1><b>Goals</b></h1>

</center>

The Goal of Gaming Bucket was for all the members to learn coding languages like c# to create video games in applications like <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> so that the members can all get jobs as game developers or keep Gaming Bucket as their own company and design games together. But with one member being a senior, going to college starting in the fall of 2020, and the other members being juniors, it's very unlikely that the four members will stay together. But in the one year they were working together, the four members did create some projects, for an example, they create an JavaScript browser fighting game were one can create their own character. The project was cancelled due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

<h1><b>Goals meet</b></h1>

</center>

Again, due to the outbreak, and due to no one knowing a real programming language before, Gaming Bucket's members were not able to learn to create games in unity in class. But Mr. Smith created a Game dev club that two of Gaming Bucket's members. The two members that went are Gregory and Andrew. The game they were making was never finished.  The game they were making was supposed to be a vr game with swinging mechanics. But the four members have learn JavaScript and they have learn how to work together as a team.
