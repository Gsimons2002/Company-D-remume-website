          Gaming Bucket is a row in a programming class in the school <i>York County School of Technology</i> that consists of four members. The members are Gregory Simons, Caleb Ritter, Johnathan Torres, and Andrew Moore. Gregory being the only
          senior in the

          group, leaving everyone else as juniors. The four members had two programming teachers. The first teacher being Patty Bacha who retired in 2019.The following year, Christopher Smith became the new teacher and was the one who created the

          teams of rows. Gaming Bucket's members have been learning to work as a team with not only their own team, but the other teams. For a few moths halfway in the school year of 2020, all the teams (A through F) where working on a JS browser
          fighting

          game. The final project was never finished due to the COVID-19 out break and all projects were cancelled. Now for a final project for the school year, all teams must create a website to show all members skills and how they all work

          as a team. And Gaming Bucket works as if each member is a gear in a well-oiled machine, meaning that we work together very well. As prof, the four members have created this website together. All credit to each member will be on the <a
            href="portfolioPage.html">Portfolio Project Page</a>up top. As more proof that the four of us work together well, we have included a project we had to do in two weeks. The project was our choice and as a team we decided to make a test
          that shows one's spartan value he or she resembles the most. In our High School, Spartan Values are something that a student should be doing, like being respectful or professional. The quiz is on the <a href="groupProject/index.html">Group
            Project page</a> up top. The project is a work in progress (WIP) and more questions will be added and it will be more accurate in the future.
