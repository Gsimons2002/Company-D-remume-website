            <h1>Who is Mrs. Bacha?</h1>
          </center>
          Mrs. Bacha was the computer programming teacher until the year 2019 when she retired. Mrs. Bacha is certified in business management, so she wasn't the best teacher for programming, but we did learn the basics of coding with HTML and CSS by reading textbooks and doing what they say. Another thing Mrs. Bacha thought us was how to manage Projects and time as if we were running a business. Everything we did, we have done hands on, by our self's or with a partner and got help when needed. But even after the classes learn that HTML and CSS isn't real coding, everyone still loved Mrs. Bacha, she was a mother figure to most if not everyone. And even though you might never see this, we all just want to say thank you for making coding fun and teaching us the basics. We all miss you.
